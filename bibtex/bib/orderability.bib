 abstract = {It is easy to pose questions about the free lattice-ordered group F? of rank $\eta > 1$ whose answers2 are "obvious", but difficult to verify. For example: 1. What is the center of F?? 2. Is F? directly indecomposable? 3. Does F? have a basic element? 4. Is F? completely distributive? Question 1 was answered recently by Medvedev, and both 1 and 2 by Arora and McCleary, using Conrad's representation of F? via right orderings of the free group G?. Here we answer all four questions by using a completely different tool: The (faithful) representation of F? as an o-2-transitive l-permutation group which is pathological (has no nonidentity element of bounded support). This representation was established by Glass for most infinite ?, and is here extended to all $\eta > 1$. Curiously, the existence of a transitive representation for F? implies (by a result of Kopytov) that in the Conrad representation there is some right ordering of G? which suffices all by itself to give a faithful representation of F?. For finite ?, we find that every transitive representation of F? can be made from a pathologically o-2-transitive representation by blowing up the points to o-blocks; and every pathologically o-2-transitive representation of F? can be extended to a pathologically o-2-transitive representation of F?0 .},
