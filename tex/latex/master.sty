% these packages are incompatible with beamer so I had to move them:
\usepackage{enumitem}
\usepackage{moreenum}

% for some reason "alt" is taken in beamer:
% alternating map
\DeclareMathOperator{\alt}{alt}
% the letter document class already has \ps (for a P.S.) so this creates an error
\newcommand{\ps}[1]{\left\llbracket #1 \right\rrbracket}

% beamer also hates some of my environments
%ENVIRONMENTS
%environments get:
%	definition
%	crefname (theorems, lemmas, propositions, and conjectures are always capitalized.
%	Everything else is controlled by cref)
%	numberwithin setting(in cls files) (e.g. 
%\numberwithin{equation}{chapter})
%	Snippet
