% Most of my macros are in master_SUB
\usepackage{master_SMALL}

% beamer hates some of my environments, so I put them in a separate style file. 
\usepackage{master_NO_beamer}

% So in a beamer file I call for master_SMALL.sty, and master_ENVIRON2.sty manually. This way I can isolate further elements of these macros for certain situations (publication-specific document classes, etc.) while maintaining backwards compatibility.
